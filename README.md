# Stock Market Prediction Project

## General Description and Goal
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting major stock market indices, with a primary focus on the DAX index. Using a multi-faceted approach to data acquisition, modeling, and evaluation, the project explores how alternative data sources and advanced deep learning techniques can enhance index predictions. The ultimate goal is to compare the return generated by our model over time against the actual return of the DAX index, assessing its performance as a potential trading tool or advisory model.

## Data Acquisition
We gather a diverse array of financial and sentiment data from multiple sources to inform model predictions:

- **Yfinance**: Provides comprehensive financial data, including historical price and volume information for a variety of financial instruments.
- **Alpaca**: Supplies up-to-date news relevant to the market.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: We perform sentiment analysis on financial news articles to gauge public sentiment and its potential impact on market movements.
- **Raw Material Price Forecasting**: Leverages data on raw material prices, which are indicators of economic health and commodity demand.
- **Correlation with Key Stocks and Indices**: Analysis of stocks that exhibit high correlation with major indices.
- **Interest Rate Influence**: Examines the relationship between interest rate trends and index performance.
- **Fear and Greed Index**: A sentiment indicator that gauges market mood, providing insights into investor behavior.

## Target
The model aims to predict the movement of a major index, with a primary focus on the **DAX index**. Various prediction frequencies will be tested to determine the most effective intervals for forecasting and trading.

## Modeling
We explore several advanced modeling techniques to handle complex time series data and generate accurate predictions:

- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: A recurrent neural network architecture effective in capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data.
- **Multi-Input Network**: Utilizes multiple input sources, such as financial data and sentiment scores, to inform predictions.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Helps the model focus on significant parts of the data, potentially improving prediction accuracy.
- **Dropout Regularization**: Applied to prevent overfitting, enhancing model generalization on unseen data.

## Performance Criteria
Our model is evaluated using a key performance criterion:

- **Return Over Time**: Compares the model-generated return over time against the actual return of the DAX index to assess prediction quality and practical viability as a trading tool.

Through this project, we aim to build a model that not only demonstrates strong predictive capabilities but also outperforms standard index returns, adding measurable value to investment strategies.
